GnuCash Stock Portfolio Utilities
=================================

[GnuCash][GnuCash] Python helper script to add stock quotes (commodity prices) from online sources.
GnuCash already supports online quotes, but these are not implemented for all stock exchanges (e.g. Yahoo Finance does not work with German bonds).
Instead of hacking Perl and/or changing the C source of GnuCash I'm using the GnuCash backend as an API from Python.

    sudo apt-get install python-gnucash
    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

Work in progress...
